Since 1990, ASCCI has combined experience and expertise to become the leader in providing its Southern and Central Alberta clients with the most modern integration and communication solutions for their ever changing needs.

In May 2015, ASCCI changed its name to All Systems Communications Contracting Inc. to better reflect who we are and what we do.

Through our long-term association in the industry, we have developed a solid understanding of the unique requirements of healthcare, education, distinctive facilities, corporate, senior living, and house of worship facilities and provide the connectivity and systems to manage the information traffic in multiple media.

With a combination of solid contracting knowledge and the authorized distributorship for the premier products available for these markets, ASCCI has enjoyed a majority market share for the past twenty years.

Full-Service Approach
We provide experience and innovation in designing telecommunications systems. We ensure that each system is custom designed with the facilityâ€™s specific needs in mind. This process prevents clients from having to pay for unnecessary and unused functions or conversely suffer insufficient performance capability.

Training
We utilize factory representatives to provide in-house factory training. ASCCI also provides customer specific in-house training.
